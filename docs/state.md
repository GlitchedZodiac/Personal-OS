**Last updated:** 2026-08-08 (phase1b session)
**Current phase:** Phase 1 COMPLETE. Phase 2 is next: Michael is running the
design brief through Claude design; 2b (chat surface) can start once the AI
provider decision lands.
**Branch in flight:** `claude/phase1-modernization` — deployed to prod via
`vercel deploy --prod` (twice); UNPUSHED to GitHub (403 — collaborator access
pending, see deferred-items).

## 2026-08-09 — AI provider decision + GPT-5.6 tier upgrade

Michael decided: **all-OpenAI, one bill** — bilingual voice quality is the
deciding factor (no Anthropic audio API), and the reasoning need is coaching/
math-grade. Budget target ≤ $0.50/day.

- **GPT-5.6 tier system wired** (probed live on his key; pricing per OpenAI
  July 2026 cuts): `terra` ($2/$12) = everyday CHAT_MODEL (chat parsing, meal
  photos — vision verified); `sol` ($5/$30) = COACH_MODEL (workout-plan
  generation, trends insights/projections, reasoningEffort medium); `luna`
  ($0.20/$1.20) available via env. Overrides: OPENAI_MODEL / OPENAI_COACH_MODEL.
- **5.6 API rule discovered**: tools + reasoning not supported on
  chat-completions → chat route sets reasoning_effort "none" (right for parse
  turns anyway); Responses API migration queued for the 2b rebuild.
- **Token discipline**: 1500-token cap on chat turns; synthesis budgets raised
  (1200/2000, 1400/2200) because reasoning tokens share max_completion_tokens
  — a 220-token cap would have returned empty insights.
- Live-verified: Spanish breakfast parse (2 items, Colombian-aware macros,
  3.7s) + Spanish follow-up correction re-totaled correctly (2.3s). 2-3×
  faster than 5.5.
- Deploy #3 to prod. Xcode NOT installed on this Mac (CLT only) — full Xcode
  is Michael's action item before the watch phase.

## 2026-08-08 — Phase 1b session (Prisma 7, TS 6, tests, prod deploys)

Michael approved "run phase 1" and took the design brief to Claude design.

- **Prod deploy #1** (pre-Prisma work): security middleware + AI layer live.
  Verified: prod `/api/todos` 401 (was publicly 200!), PIN page renders, cron
  end-to-end 200 with real CRON_SECRET.
- **Prisma 5.22 → 7.9.1**: `prisma.config.ts` (URLs out of schema;
  `process.loadEnvFile` locally, platform env on Vercel); driver adapter
  `@prisma/adapter-pg` (engine-era URL params stripped, pool max 5) in
  `lib/prisma.ts` + `lib/prisma-request.ts`; **client-bundle leak fixed** —
  `route-map.tsx` (client) imported `lib/strava` → prisma → pg; extracted
  `decodePolyline` to client-safe `lib/polyline.ts`.
- **Migration history established**: JSON backup of all 43 models (1,698 rows)
  to `~/VibeCoding/personal-os-backups/` first; `0_init` baseline; **live-DB
  drift healed** — 25 missing FKs added (zero-orphan-verified), indexes
  renamed to Prisma conventions, `updatedAt` defaults dropped; drift re-diff
  now empty; archived as `manual-migrations/20260808_align_db_to_schema.sql`.
- **TypeScript 5 → 6.0.3**: TS 7.0.2 proven (Next typecheck 210ms native)
  but typescript-eslint blocks <7.1 — flip deferred. ESLint runs again;
  pre-existing finance-inbox errors deferred.
- **Tests 13 → 43**: extracted food-timing inference from the chat route to
  `lib/food-timing.ts`; new suites: food-timing (14), timezone (7),
  health-tools contract (5), strava/polyline (4). Caught own vitest-green/
  tsc-broken cast bug — the exact trap the TPL merge gate exists for.
- **Prod deploy #2**: full Phase 1 state live. Self-smoke on prod after.

## 2026-08-08 — Phase 1 modernization session (Claude, hands-off evening run)

Context: app untouched ~5 months; Michael set the new direction (health-first
lifelong app, voice/AI first, then Claude-design redesign, then watch app).

Shipped:

- **Access restored**: repo cloned to `~/VibeCoding/Mikes Personal OS`, Vercel
  CLI linked (`personal-os`), prod env pulled, DB connection rebuilt
  (Supabase pooler `aws-1-us-east-1`, password in `.env.local` only). App
  boots locally against production data (419 food logs, 100 workouts).
- **Security**: RLS enabled on all 43 public tables (anon key now reads 0 rows;
  Prisma unaffected — verified both sides). Dead `lib/supabase.ts` +
  `@supabase/supabase-js` removed. **`proxy.ts` added — the previously wide-open
  `/api/*` surface (confirmed 200 unauthenticated on prod) now requires the
  signed auth cookie** except auth/cron/mobile/OAuth-callback routes.
- **Deps**: Next 16.1.6→16.3.0, React 19.2.3→19.2.8, lucide/sonner/tw-merge
  bumped. Prisma 5→7 and TS 5→7 deliberately deferred (tasks #4/#5).
- **AI layer modernized** (the "voice + AI first" directive):
  - Deprecated `functions` API → modern `tools` API (`lib/ai-prompts.ts`
    exports `HEALTH_TOOLS`).
  - `/api/ai/chat` now accepts `history` — **real back-and-forth works**
    (self-smoke: "actually it was three eggs" returned the delta, live).
  - `voice-input.tsx` keeps a rolling 12-message history.
  - Transcription `whisper-1` → **`gpt-transcribe`** with a domain-vocabulary
    prompt (kettlebell/macros/Colombian food); whisper-1 fallback. Self-smoke:
    synthesized kettlebell audio transcribed flawlessly.
  - Meal photo analysis → strict `json_schema` structured outputs.
  - All model ids centralized in `lib/openai.ts` (`CHAT_MODEL` = gpt-5.5,
    override via `OPENAI_MODEL`).
- **Bug fixes** (from `docs/bug-backlog.md`): UTC date-key drift in
  trends/daily-log `isToday` and workout-plan chat history grouping; mojibake
  🔁 in todos; repo-wide mojibake scan clean.
- **Docs**: CLAUDE.md (operating model, adapted from TPL), this file,
  `deferred-items.md`, `MODERNIZATION-PLAN.md`, `design/claude-design-brief.md`,
  `.env.example`, rewritten README.

Verification: `npm run build` green (type-checked), vitest 13/13, middleware
401/200 both directions, live two-turn chat + workout logging + transcription
against the dev server with a locally minted cookie.
